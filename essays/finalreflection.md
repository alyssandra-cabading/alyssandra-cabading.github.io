## The Night Drive Back Home
Do you know that feeling you get after a night out with your friends? You're sitting in the car, windows down with the wind blowing through your hair, the street lights to be the only luminance, while the faint sound of the radio plays. It's such a nostalgic but wistful feeling. You're aware that everything is coming to an end, but you savor those few moments hoping the experience will last. That's how I am feeling about my third semester learning Software Engineering. I have enjoyed multiple aspects of it,but it's all coming to a close and I don't want that experience to end. And I won't let it.

During my time learning more about software engineering, I learned a great deal about the various branches that composes the entirety of it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all rainbows and unicorns as there were are a lot of different topics that I needed to spend a little more time in, as you would cultivating a healthy friendship with someone. While some topics initially felt irrelevant to learn, similar to how we tend to have a slightly bad first impressions of meeting someone new, once you peel the layers back it reveals a great deal of positive characteristics. And sometimes those positive characteristics are necessary for the development of others.

## The First Impressions of a Future Friend

One notable topic that I initially felt was unnecessary was the concept of Agile Project Management. I felt this way because I expected that in any project, that you may work on with others or merely as an individual, need to have a general structure of what mini subtasks must be handled. I have always viewed it as a "we communicate what must be done, formulate a solution, and execute it". But when I look back at that mindset, I now realize how chaotic that can be. It is disorganized and inevitably leaves a lot of room for error. Not to mention, it can result in a product that may work but is not as cohesive as it could have possibly been. From this topic I learned to develop efficient ways to divide work evenly and construct them in a logistically efficient way. This was done so with the implementation of Project Boards. The project boards are designed to generate milestones, which are essentially the main goals of the overall project. Within them are the different tasks relative to the description of the goal. This allows to allocate tasks between the group, while holding accountability. Furthermore, it reinforces the cohesiveness of the project. If we don't know what progress one individual has made in a certain area it makes it difficult to pinpoint what can be improved upon or even identify what kind of error the system may be presenting. Overall Agile Project Management is a necessity that cultivates creative and robust applications that in the end everyone who contributed to it, understands the ins and outs...sort of like an inside joke amongst friends.

## The Friend We Love and Hate
We all have that one friend that sometimes ge under our skin but for the best reasons we love and they are as equally important in our lives. That is my relationship with Functional Programming. Earlier in the semester we covered functional programming and to be quite honest I had a difficult time grasping my head around it. I understood the concepts, but the implementation was what I struggled with the most. However, I learned that it is so crucial as it makes functions that seem difficult to code much more simpler than we thought. The aspect of Functional Programming that I will emphasize are the Underscore Functions. These little guys are the absolute best. I love to describe them as a sort of thesaurus for when you need to search up an "avant-garde" word that spices your vocabulary up. Needless to say it was a very pivotal topic. I will be transparent and say that I am not the best when it comes to coding back-end functions. But this topic really opened my eyes as to what efficient coding may look like. So taking what I learned from previous languages such as Java, C, C++, I was able to alter my perception towards it. Rather than looking at it as a whole new world of language, I viewed it as a tool that would better help me develop the skills that I already had.

## The Friend We See Ourselves In
My personal favorite topic was the User Interface Frameworks. This was the element I thrived in. I love seeing and implementing design with a definite weakness for the arts. The User Interface Frameworks section did a wonderful job of intertwining the world of Computer Science and the world of Art. As we know user interfaces are important because they are the ones that essentially leaves the first impressions for the audience. While the inner functionality of an application is robust, no one will be inclined to stick around if it is not presented to their likings and convenience. People are quite simple-minded as they want what is efficient and easy for them to navigate around. This area topic help me understand that, and allow me to develop my skills in creating such environments that mimic what the user would expect to see, but at the same time would be surprised to see. An aspect of UI frameworks that I will emphasize on is the implementation of Semantic UI. I may be biased but Semantic UI is quite one of the most beautiful creations I have seen. It is so easy to use but it can be manipulated in so many different ways that fit the standards of others and most especially what we have envision to be a great representation of our code. The User Interface Frameworks help me realize that the project does not end between you and your group members. It extends all the way to one's consumers. Personally, I think it is a lifelong friend that you view to be your own moral compass.

## The Endless Journey of a Lifetime Friendship
While the end may be here, it does not have to stop here. Despite getting home after that time-stopping drive, I have the power to choose whether or not I will hang out with my friends again. Software Engineering is a vast world of learning and creation, so for me to say that the end is here is simply incorrect. The end is here, only if I deem it to be. Learning about it has opened my eyes as to what I truly love about Computer Science and for that I am so thankful. Needless to say, I will continue learn and implement what I have gotten out of it during such a short time. There are still aspects that I want to improve upon as I know I still have an area of major weaknesses. It has been absolute roller coaster to say the least, but definitely worth the patience and time to wait in line for. It is a lifetime friendship that I am looking to cultivate and develop as time passes by.
