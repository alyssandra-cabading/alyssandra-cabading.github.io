## Is There Such Thing As a Stupid Question
<p> We all know the notorious line we have heard our teachers say at least once and that is there are no such thing as a stupid question. This phrase suggests that knowledge always comes with failure and that no one should ever be afraid to ask for help when they feel lost. As this saying is thrown around, it sort of loses its meaning. To keep it simple, the phrase is misconstrued as an excuse to be fed the answers as a result of laziness.While this may not always be the case for every individual who asks a “stupid” question, we must learn to differentiate between the “stupid” questions implied by the teachers and the “not so smart” questions that many confuses it with. To do this, we must begin to understand what constitutes a “smart” question. </p>

## The Question We Are All Looking For
<p> To begin with, smart questions are not selfish. In other words, they are formulated from authentic curiosity backed by built knowledge. It is not a sad excuse to be spoon-fed an answer one feels entitled to. Smart questions have an effect of enhancing the learning environment. This means that rather than just asking for an answer to get an answer, smart questions go through a deliberate and thoughtful process of asking for one. Prior to asking a smart question, an individual must do their part by looking for the answer. This can be done by researching keywords on Google or forums that may cover such topics. Needless to say, smart questions are formulated from acquired knowledge and essentially persistence. The formulation of such a question takes into consideration its clarity and its complexity. In simpler terms, it makes the question clear and precise for the individuals that one may be asking it from. If no one understands what is being asked, well, then that leaves for more questions to be formed. </p>
