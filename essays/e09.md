**Javascript is the New Black**

Javascript is the new black...well, let me rephrase that. Javascript is the promising language of the future. In this new day and age everything is built around time. The language’s shorthand abilities are so much more comprehensive and convenient. Personally, I knew a little bit about Javascript and this knowledge included a misjudgment of it being “intimidating”. Boy was I wrong! After dipping my toes into the “belly of the beast”, I learned that it is just a condensed version of Java to say the least. While preferences differ among many, it is much more compelling to learn more about Javascript and discern if it is truly of my liking....analogous to deciding whether or not to binge watch that Netflix show about orange being the new black.

**Works Smarter Not Harder**

An observation I have made, after going through a series of mini lessons on [_freeCodeCamp_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), is the simplicity of Javascript. It is the type of simplicity that one should not frown upon because it’s a system that works just as well if not better than comparable languages, such as Java or C/C++. An example of this simplicity is the creation of objects. In Java, a separate class is needed in order to instantiate from it. Whereas in Javascript an object does not need to be instantiated from a given class. To reiterate Javascript is fairly simple but it is also flexible and easy to learn for fairly experienced programmers. Like any language, it requires a lot of discipline to truly understand its bounds and utilize its smarter-not-harder structure, efficiently.
	

**What WOD I Do Without It**

Workout of the days, also known as WODs, are advantageous exercises that certainly challenges one’s own coding competency. From a personal standpoint, it is an absolute necessity for improving upon problem solving skills when it comes to code. I, myself, am not what one would call an expert coder that can formulate content at such a short amount of time. While my skills lean more towards being detail-oriented/analytical, WODs are a perfect balance of flexibility and efficiency. It trains you how to produce optimum results quickly, but at the same time allow you to understand why that is so important. Despite being something out of my comfort zone, it enables me to expand the circle of comfortability with programming. With these WODs it reminds me to take into account the importance of daily implementation.
