## The Warm Up
<p>What a workout it has been with trying to wrap my head around UI Frameworks this past week. Like going to the gym or going out to run...it is a love and hate relationship. Wait...you’ve never heard of such a thing before? Well don’t fret, cause I’m here to break down the sets and reps, but let’s start with a little warm-up. Let’s begin.</p>
<p>What are UI Frameworks? I can begin by telling you the technicalities of it all, but I don’t want to strain your brain muscles just yet. To keep it simple, UI Framework is the magic behind the many websites and applications you have seen across different platforms of the internet and devices. It is what helps structure a user-friendly environment while establishing an aesthetically pleasing look...well at least for some. From a personal standpoint, it’s an absolute necessity because it’s what helps lure the audience to utilize what a developer has created. Although we must not judge a book by its cover, first impressions remain important. So if a website or application look cheap and unappealing chances are people feel less inclined to give it a chance. So that’s where UI Frameworks come into play even further!

## The Sets and Reps
<p>Now that I covered the gist of UI Frameworks let’s dive in to our sets. Think of UI Frameworks as the weights or treadmills in a gym, essentially as a tool. You can choose not to use it, but might you learn to use it properly the progress towards that desired look is even closer! Although learning UI Frameworks take a lot of patience and practice as like with any language, it makes programming a design fun and much easier.</p>
<p>Over this past week I have learned to build a set of mock websites. I will admit, it was not that easy. The tools and instructions were in front of me, but I had to train again and again just to fully grasp its functionality. What do I mean by this? I’m talking about the different classes of elements and behaviors such as containers, grids, segments, lists as well as the variations that come along with it. It was a bit overwhelming, more so because I was genuinely excited to use all of them all at once. But analogous to working out, we shouldn’t be doing multiple reps at once. It needs to be taken in chunks hence our sets.</p>


## Decompress to Impress
