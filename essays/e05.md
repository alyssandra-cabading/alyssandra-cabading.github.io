## A Fork In the Road

Life has its high expectations especially when it comes to figuring out what to be when you “grow up”. During my senior year of high school, I did not exactly know what major I wanted to pursue. I have had this subconscious belief that in order to be successful I have to become a nurse or an engineer. With this engraved in my mind, I have set standards that were so incredibly excessive that whenever I did fall short of certain aspects in life, I found myself questioning...Am I doing this right? Nevertheless, I was hitting a fork in the road in which either path inevitably led to another one. Despite the multiple forks I have hit along the way, it brought me to where I am today, pursuing a degree that I have grown to love. Computer Science is definitely a path I would not have guessed to have been of my interest, though I have come to realize that it is definitely the path I have been looking for.
