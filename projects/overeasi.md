**OverEASI** is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 314 (Fall 2020), and simultaneously as a NIC Hawaii chatbot challenge solution for the Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge (HACC) 2020. This project allowed me to explore the work that goes on to creating a responsive website that is flexible and easy to use.
