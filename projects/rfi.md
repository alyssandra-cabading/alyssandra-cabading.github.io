**Reclaiming Filipinx Identity** is an independent Media company that is 100% self funded. 

<p>Since creating a podcast that not only captures narratives for the Filipinx community in Hawaii. We also wanted to branch to a media company to bridge the gap with the many different Filipinos globally by creating an open space for healthy conversation.</p> 
<p>As fellow Kasama and Kababayans, Reclaiming Filipinx Identity continues to create content that will bridge the gap with different issues that is happening to the community by addressing it through series like our 'FIlipinx Mental Health Mukbang' and many more content to follow.</p>

## The Mission Statement

## My Role
>The sole duties of a Graphic Designer is in its name. Some responsibilities include designing infographics and the company's logo. My contribution also includes editing Youtube videos in which a set of guest panelists across the country are given the platform to address Mental Health Topics. The podcast aspect of Reclaiming Filipinx Identity caters to Filipinx/Fil-Am in Hawaii. My duties with podcasts are to create cover arts that embodies the story of the guest being interviewed. Occasionally I assist in creating highlights for each podcast episode to share among the audience via Instagram, which is a great segway. For Instragram, my contributions lean more toward the visual content—creating impactful art that captures the audiences attention. Last but not least, the RFI website. The website is most especially my favorite aspect of the company for this is where we provide a platform for those interested in sharing their stories in different forms of art. This include music, poems and narratives. The website is an aspect of our company I desire to improve upon as I learn more about the wonders of Software Development.
